# YouTube-revenue-analysis
As a Power BI developer, the goal is to analyze a YouTube dataset to extract
valuable insights and provide actionable recommendations for content creators
and marketers. The dataset comprises various engagement metrics and videos
attributes obtained from YouTube's API, enabling us to delve into viewer
behavior, video performance, and factors influencing engagement. The analysis
will empower stakeholders to optimize their content strategies and enhance
audience engagement on the platform.

Problem Statement:
The primary objective of this analysis is to uncover patterns, trends, and
correlations within the YouTube dataset focusing on engagement metrics and
video attributes. The analysis aims to answer key questions that will guide
content creators and marketers in making informed decisions to improve their
YouTube content and maximize viewer interaction.

Tasks To Be Performed:
1. Display the maximum uploads in a card visual.
2. Display the minimum view ranks in a card visual.
3. Display the average views for the last 30 days in a card visual. (Data
Cleansing is required).
4. Generate a line chart to highlight the title and maximum upload only who
crossed 2 lakh uploads.
5. Use a spider map (radar chart) to display channel type and channel rank.
6. Create a packed bubble chart to display category-wise subscribers.
7. Create a calculated column to find Views per Subscriber as ‘Viewed by
Subscriber’.
8. Create a table visual to represent the channel type and views per
subscriber.
9. Create a measure to find total uploads and use the card visuals to
represent the total uploads.
10. Create a decomposition tree to represent rank-wise categories.
11. Create a blank navigation button to navigate between two pages.
12. Format your report by adding headings and logos.
13. Publish your report to the Power BI Service.
14. Create a dashboard with 3 important visuals.
15. From the Power BI Service, download the copy of your report in a
pdf/ppt format.

The channel "T-Series" records the highest number of uploads globally, demonstrating high production output and broad audience reach.

Minimum View Ranks (Card Visual)

Several niche channels hold the lowest view ranks, highlighting under-served content categories and opportunities for new entrants.

Average Views—Last 30 Days (Card Visual, Cleansed)
---
Data cleansing was performed to eliminate outliers and missing entries, resulting in an accurate measure of average views per channel over the past month.

Title & Max Uploads > 200,000 (Line Chart)
---
Only a selective group of channels, led by T-Series, exceeded 200,000 uploads; these were highlighted in a comparative line chart to showcase the output scale.

Spider Map (Radar Chart): Channel Type & Rank
---
A radar chart visually mapped the correlation between channel type ("Music," "Entertainment," "Games," etc.) and their rank, helping identify top-performing categories.

Packed Bubble Chart: Category-wise Subscribers
---
Categories like Music and Entertainment dominate subscriber counts, with bubbles sized to reflect follower magnitude across genres.

Calculated Column: Views per Subscriber ("Viewed by Subscriber")

A new metric was introduced to measure average views per subscriber per channel, enabling benchmarking of audience engagement efficiency.

Table Visual: Channel Type & Views per Subscriber
---
Tabulated data provides a clear comparison of which channel types drive the most engagement per subscriber.

Measure: Total Uploads & Card Visuals
---
Aggregate total uploads across all channels were calculated and visually represented to display the platform’s content production scale.

Decomposition Tree: Rank-wise Categories
---
A dynamic tree visual was created to break down categories by channel rank, revealing how top channels cluster and compete within genres.

Blank Navigation Button
---
Navigational elements were added to facilitate switching between report pages in Power BI.

Best Practices and Recommendations
